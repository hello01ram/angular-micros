# angular-micros
Angular projects to demonstrate micro-frontend using module federation

To use the applications, first install all dependencies for each application using `npm install` 

second, run `ng serve -o` for each application


Note: there are 2 applications. One is setup to run on port 5000, and another on port 3000. If the projects are running 
on different ports, that will cause the application to break
